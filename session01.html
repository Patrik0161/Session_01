  <h1>Introduction to the things im studying and about to study in order to become a better developer.</h1>
  <h3>My name is Patrik Racz and i study at Manchester College.</h3>
  <h3>Grades i achieved that got me into Level 3 course are:</h3>

  <p>Im a new student at Manchester College. I just started my first year doing Level 3 Computer Science.
     Im lucky that i have achieved quite good grades and dont have to resit neither English or Maths.
      So now i have all my time focused only on the course which helps me achieve the best grade.</p>

    <p>I chose this path because since i was a kid i was always front of the computer and it really attracted me. Thats when i knew this is what i would like to do in thef future and now im one step closer to that.
    There are many thinghs you could learn in I.T like designing websites, coding, softwaring etc.
     Altough, i prefer to become a website developer because thats what attracts me and i like the most.</p>
